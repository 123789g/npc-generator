# NPC Generator is a self-explanatory tool for creating interesting characters and prompting their stories.

The requirements I have for something like this is the ability to do the following:
1: Generate a Name. **WIP MAKE TOGGLE SO NAME GENERATED CAN BE MALE OR FEMALE | DONE**
2: Generate an age within certain limit of 150 years. **WIP MAKE SLIDER SO YOU CAN SELECT AGE LIMIT YOURSELF | DONE**
3: Assign them an Enneagram. Interesting characters are born from their beliefs and maxims. **WIP ALLOW USER TO SELECT PHILOSOPHY MBTI OR ENNEAGRAM WITHOUT UNCOMMENTING CODE**
4: Generate quirks of their character and occupation. This can be used to explain the character's past and help write their future.
5: Choose a Color. A Wind Mage that has a Blue aesthetic is going to feel very different from one with a Green aesthetic. It also can allow for interesting interpretations of color theory to tie into the character.

# Options

I haven't made anything to tweak how the moral philosophy is displayed from the user end. But you can uncomment lines 105 & 107 if you want to use MBTI or Moral Philosophies instead of Enneagrams.
